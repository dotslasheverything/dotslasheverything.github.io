                        C is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. 'C' has been one of the most popular programming languages since 1980.
                        It was initially developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is often misleading that 'C' stands for computers. However, the truth is,
                        in the year of 1972, Ritchie was working on improvising BCPL(a programming language used in olden days to write compilers for other languages)
                        to make utilities for the UNIX operating system. And he ended up creating a new programming language C. And being so user-friendly as a language,
                        later in 1973, the entire Unix kernel was extensively rewritten in C.

                                    Geeksfor Geeks is a computer science portal. It provides a vast collection of articles about C language, covering most of the C concepts.
                                    You can find C code snippets in each of the articles which illustrate the topic of discussion. You can rewrite the code, run it and see how it works, on the same page.
                                    You can learn by reading their articles and code using their online IDE. But one might feel that it is very time-consuming to read the entire collection.
                                    But you can always directly go to your topic of interest among them and read it.<br>

                                    Programiz provides free tutorials on several programming languages along with C.

                                    Tutorials follow syntax - working - examples approach. Programiz also gives you an overview of why and how much is a partiular language important,

                                    The authors aimed to show the essential elements of the C language in real programs, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions.
                                    Hence the reader is assumed to have some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions.
                                    A novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language.

                                    Along with practice problems, you can also try some coding questions which were asked in company interviews.

                                    It is known for competitive programming. Every month three featured competitions will be orgnized by codechef.
                                    Along with those several other colleges and coding clubs conduct their own competitions every now and then.
                                    Most of these competitions are open for everyone. If not intersted in competitions, you can always try to solve practice questions on their website.
                                    Code chef also has an online IDE which allows to code in 50 languages other than C.
