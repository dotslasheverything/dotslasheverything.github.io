What's it...?
		C is a general-purpose, high-level programming language.'C' has been one of the most popular programming languages since 1980.
	It was initially developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is often misleading that 'C' stands for computers. However, the truth is,
	in the year of 1972, Ritchie was working on improvising BCPL(a programming language used in olden days to write compilers for other languages)
	 to make utilities for the UNIX operating system. And he ended up creating a new programming language C. And being so user-friendly as a language,
	 later in 1973, the entire Unix kernel was extensively rewritten in C. In 1978 Ritchie and Kernighan published the first version of C as 'K&R C.'
	 Later in 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee, X3J11. It established a standard specification of C, 
	 with a few relieves to 'K&R C,' and ratified it as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C." It also went by the name 'ANSI C.' In 1990,
	 International Organization for Standardization(ISO) adopted 'ANSI C' as ISO/IEC 9899:1990. And since then, ISO has been taking care of standardizing
	 'C' language with revisions whenever required. The current standard of 'C' Programming language is 'C18'.
	USES:
 		C is known for its speed, stability, and near-universal availability.
		C enables programmers to create efficient implementations of algorithms and data structures, useful for computationally intense programs.
		C is widely used in system programming for implementing operating systems.
		Compilers, libraries, and interpreters of other programming languages are implemented in 'C.'
 		C has influenced many other languages such as C#, D, Java, Javascript, Python, PHP and Unix's C Shell
